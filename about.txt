<h1>About Me</h1>
<h2>My Current Occupation</h2>
<p>
In the fall of 2020, I transferred to the IT department of my hospital, San Antonio Regional Hospital and became a Service Desk Specialist. In this role, I am in charge of typical help desk responsibilities such as answering calls from users, helping resolve any problems I can, and making tickets for those that I cannot resolve on my own. In addition to this, I am in charge of monitoring and resolving issues related to various SFTP jobs and servers, network interfaces, and a number of other critical systems for the hospital and our varius sister locations (the various affiliated urgent cares centers and outpatient facilities). I am also commonly involved in building new PCs to be rolled ouot throughout the hospital and appropriately disposing of old devices in a HIPAA compliant manner. As a night shift employee, I am the sole individual responsible for resolving issues until the rest of the IT staff is available during weekdays/daytime hours. 
</p>

<h2>My Previous Occupation</h2>
<p>I had been a monitor technician at San Antonio Regional Hospital since the end of 2018. 
Before that, I was a monitor technician at Adventist Health Glendale (formerly Glendale Adventist Medical Center) from 2012-2018. 
As a monitor technician, I was responsible for monitoring, interpreting, recording, and communicating any changes or abnormalities in patients EKGs. 
In addition to this, I was responsible for performing roles within my scope practice during codes and rapid response situations. 
While my core responsibilities mainly involved EKGs, I was also responsible for secretarial and clerical roles such as answering all phone calls, call lights, 
and assisting those with questions and needs in the nursing station. Ultimately, I acted as point-person for all activities in the unit, and facilitated 
the needs of staff, patients, and families. </p>
<br>
<h2>Workplace Accomplishments</h2>
<p>
In my 6 years at Adventist Health Glendale, I recieved the "Monitor Tech of the Year" award three times. 
The first award was at my units holiday season party where I was voted for among my peers in my unit after only a few months of working there. 
The second award was a few months later at the annual Nurse's week brunch where I was voted Monitor Technician of the year throughout the entire hospital. 
The third award was at the holiday party where I was voted for once more by the staff in my unit. 
</p>
 
<h2>Volunteering</h2>
<p>Between 2016 and 2018, I was a volunteer in the IT department at Adventist Health Glendale where I would assist analysts with tickets,
 prepare devices/computers for deployment (put together computers, image them, run basic diagnostics), and install devices. 
Some major projects I was involved in were the rollout of Office 365 to replace our old Outlook email, setting up multiple new offices with computer installations, 
and the preparation of new computers for the opening of a new unit- the Transitional Care Unit.
<br>
In 2016, I volunteered to be part of the Armenia Mission trip with Adventist Health Glendale as a 12-Lead EKG tech, where I performed EKGs for nearly 2000 patients, was part of the early setup/teardown 
team to prepare for the arrival/departure of my peers, and helped troubleshoot any device issues whenever needed.
